Code for piezo panels which counts number of people walking in a selected area, create visualisations.

Other than the primary purpose, the code also enables the panels to gain data about weight of all the people walking over it.

Initial development of the project was done over the Arduino IDE, however the limitations of the same led to switch to MATLAB. 
To run this code, you'd need to install the MATLAB's 'Hardware support package for Arduino'. Make sure the correct port is selected.
This code is compatible with Arduino Uno. You may, however with a few tweaks, run this code on different boards.
